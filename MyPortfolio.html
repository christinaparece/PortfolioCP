                        I hold a degree in Bachelor of Science, Travel-Tourism & Hospitality Management and I currently work as a travel manager, but I always felt a need to do  something more challenging in my life. <br>I realized being a woman in tech, would enhance my capabilities to achieve my professional, intellectual and entrepreneurial goals.

                            <li> <b>Traveling</b> &nbsp;My most favorite thing to do is to travel. My love of travel began when I was 16. I went on my first international trip to Mexico, It made me realize I wanted to travel more and explore different cultures, food and hospitality. To date, I have traveled to 22 countries, and atleast 15 states within the US. </li> 
                            <li> <b>Dancing</b> &nbsp; I was enrolled in a dance academy for 14 years, during which I performed ballet, tap and hiphop dances. I currently spend some free time taking salsa and bachata lessons. I enjoy watching amatuer and professional dancing performances. </li>
                            <li> <b>Strength Training</b>&nbsp; Though this is a new hobby, I can be found in the gym at least four days a week. I enjoy setting personal goals, this motivates me to continue onward and pushing myself to get stronger.</li>
                            <li> <b>Skiing</b>&nbsp; I enjoy the snow and had always dabbled in snowboarding. I recently picked up skiing and found it to be more enjoyable and safier. I am a Indy pass holder and plan to optomize my new gear this ski season. </li>
